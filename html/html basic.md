## Lists
A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consist of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:

1. Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list. These are wrapped in a `<ul>` element.
2. Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are wrapped in an `<ol> `element.

Each item inside the lists is put inside an `<li>` (list item) element.
