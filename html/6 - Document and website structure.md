`<span>` is an inline non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think of a better semantic text element to wrap your content, or don't want to add any specific meaning. For example:

`<div>` is a block level non-semantic element, which you should only use if you can't think of a better semantic block element to use, or don't want to add any specific meaning.
